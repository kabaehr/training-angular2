## Exercise 6 ##

In this exercise, we are going to unit test the code of our application.


### Tasks ###

1. Add a unit test that tests that an expense record can be deleted in the backend.

2. Add a unit test that tests the deletion of an expense in `expense-overview.component.spec.ts`


### Implementations Hints ###

1. Add a unit test that tests that an expense record can be deleted in `ExpenseRepositoryTests.cs`. Implement it in the test method `CanDeleteRecord()`.

2. Add a unit test that tests the deletion of an expense in `expense-overview.component.spec.ts`. For orientation, you can refer to the already existing `"should show two expenses after OnInit"` unit test.
